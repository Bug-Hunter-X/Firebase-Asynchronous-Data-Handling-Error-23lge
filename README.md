# Firebase Asynchronous Data Handling Error

This repository demonstrates and provides a solution for a common yet often overlooked error in Firebase applications. This error occurs when you attempt to access data fetched asynchronously before it has fully loaded, leading to `undefined` values and unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The provided code sample illustrates an incorrect approach to handling asynchronous data retrieval with Firebase.  Accessing the `userData` variable before the `once()` callback completes results in `undefined`, potentially causing errors in your application. 

## Solution

The solution presented handles the asynchronous nature of Firebase correctly, ensuring that `userData` is accessed only after the data is fetched and populated.
