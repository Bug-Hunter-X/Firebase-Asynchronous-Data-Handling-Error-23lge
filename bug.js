The following Firebase code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Incorrect asynchronous handling
db.ref('users').once('value', function(snapshot) {
  const userData = snapshot.val();
  // Accessing userData outside the callback is problematic because it might not be ready yet.
  console.log(userData.name); // This might lead to undefined error
});

// Subsequent code that depends on userData will run before the data has been fetched.
console.log('This line runs before userData is populated.');
```

This type of error frequently arises due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase's data retrieval methods. If the subsequent code relies on `userData` before the Firebase callback function completes, the value will be `undefined`, resulting in an error.
